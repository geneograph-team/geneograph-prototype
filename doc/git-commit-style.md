# Git commit style

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD025 -->

This document defines commit-message standards for pull requests made by the ChatGPT chat version through the connected GitHub repository. It does not apply to Codex working in the local checkout; Codex must not run Git commands or commit changes.

## Purpose

The described commit message format is necessary for:

- Convenient reading, understanding, and searching of changes.
- Building collaboration between team members.
- Supporting automatic changelog generation.
- Simplifying change tracking and issue debugging.

## Commit granularity

- Make **one commit per logical change**, including all affected files in
  that same commit. Never create separate commits merely because the change
  touches multiple files.
- For a focused issue or pull request, aim for **one complete commit** after
  implementation and verification, rather than a stream of per-file or
  intermediate fixup commits.
- Split commits only when the work contains genuinely independent,
  reviewable logical changes or when a later review requires a follow-up.
  Squash incidental fixups before merging when the repository workflow
  permits it; do not force-push or rewrite shared history without approval.
- With connected GitHub tools, batch file contents into a single Git tree
  and commit. Repeated per-file Contents API updates each create a commit
  and should not be used for a multi-file logical change.

## Commit message structure

### 1. Header

- __Format__: `<Verb> <noun>`
- __Capitalized__ first letter.
- __Maximum length__: 72 characters.
- __Imperative mood__ (e.g., `Fix`/`Add`/`Remove`, not `Fixed`/`Added`).
- __No prefixes__ such as `[Fix]` or `[Feature]`.

Examples of correct commits:

- `Fix memory leak in data parser`
- `Add user profile validation`

Examples of commits that are not allowed to be merged:

- `Fixed bug` - too vague
- `[Feature] New login screen` - prefix is not allowed

### 2. Body (optional, for complex changes)

- Explain __what changed__ and __why__.
- Keep text within __72 characters__ per line.
- Use a bulleted list for multiple changes (when squashing).

Correct example:

```text
Optimize database query performance

- Replace nested queries with JOINs
- Add indexes on frequently filtered columns
- Reduces response time by ~40% in benchmarks
```

### 3. Footer (optional, for metadata)

- Issue references (e.g., `Closes #123`).
- Co-authors (e.g., `Co-authored-by: Name <email>`).

## Common mistakes

- Using tags or metadata:
  - Incorrect: `[BUGFIX] Fix null pointer exception`
  - Correct: `Fix null pointer exception in parser`

- Wrong verb form:
  - Incorrect: `Fixed broken tests`
  - Correct: `Fix broken unit tests`

- Verbs not in the imperative mood:
  - Incorrect: `Fixes rendering bug`
  - Correct: `Fix rendering bug`

- Vague messages:
  - Incorrect: `Make it better`
  - Correct: `Improve image loading performance`

- Incorrect noun placement:
  - Incorrect: `Add support compression`
  - Correct: `Add compression support`

## Commit message examples

### Single-line messages

```text
Fix race condition in thread manager
```

```text
Refactor configuration parser
```

```text
Update dependencies to latest versions
```

```text
Remove legacy compatibility layer
```

### Multi-line messages

```text
Improve error handling in network module

Added comprehensive error checking for socket operations and implemented
proper cleanup routines for failed connections. The changes prevent
memory leaks during network failures.
```

```text
Add performance benchmarks for core functions

Implemented a new benchmarking suite that measures execution time of
critical path operations. Includes tests for various input sizes and
edge cases.
```
